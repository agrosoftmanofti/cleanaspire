### üöÄ Overview  

**CleanAspire** is a cutting-edge, open-source template built on **.NET 9**, designed to accelerate the development of **lightweight**, **fast**, and **simple** Blazor WebAssembly or Progressive Web Applications (PWA). It seamlessly integrates **Minimal APIs**, **Aspire**, and **Scalar** for modern API documentation.  

With a focus on **Clean Architecture** and **extreme code simplicity**, CleanAspire provides developers with the tools to create responsive and maintainable web applications with minimal effort. The template also supports **Microsoft.Kiota** to simplify API client generation, ensuring consistency and productivity in every project.  

### üåê Offline Support  

CleanAspire fully supports **offline mode** through its integrated PWA capabilities, enabling your application to function seamlessly without an internet connection. By leveraging **Service Workers** and **browser caching**, the application can store essential resources and data locally, ensuring quick load times and uninterrupted access. Additionally, CleanAspire offers streamlined configuration options to help developers manage caching strategies and data synchronization effortlessly, guaranteeing that users receive the latest updates once the network is restored.

**Key Features of Offline Support:**

- **Service Workers Integration:** Efficiently handle caching and background synchronization to manage offline functionality.
- **Automatic Resource Caching:** Automatically caches essential assets and API responses, ensuring critical parts of the application are accessible offline.
- **Seamless Data Synchronization:** Maintains data consistency by synchronizing local changes with the server once the connection is reestablished.
